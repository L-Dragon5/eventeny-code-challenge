# Eventeny Code Challenge
## Requirements:
* PHP
* SQL
* Javascript (jQuery allowed)
* HTML
* CSS

## Tasks:
### Minimum functionality:
* Create a simple discount code
  * Ability for an admin to create, ~~read~~, update, and ~~delete~~ a discount code
  * ~~Ability for a user to apply a discount to a shopping cart~~

### Functionality I'd like to add with it:
* Start time and expiration date for discount code
* Number of uses for discount code

Decided to have the admin side use AJAX and have the cart not.
Just to showcase that I can do both.
